	I designed from the scratch starting from just an idea. Doing this project really helped me learn each process of designing the app, from the idea to wireframe to prototype to finish. I myself train jiu-jitsu and I came up with this app because I want to use it. I enjoy making user interface both by design tools and coding. I'm currently coding the interface of the app in xcode.
