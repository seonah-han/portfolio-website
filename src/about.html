			<h1>Proud nerd</h1>
			<p>I was a full time nerd at McGill studying mathematics and computer science. I love logic and breaking down a complicated probelems into more manageable until it gets down to a simple mathe or true or false. <!-- i soon realize the fact that computer science is somewhat an extension of math. The very first computer language C and java later one. I had fun participating or organizing hakathon. I had a privilege to meet and inpiring people Amaxing minds. I hope one day I could inspire other people through my career. -->
